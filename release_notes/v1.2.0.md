# Feature Release  
Major changes (Changes that cause restarts are in bold):
- ### All containers have been updated to use a more optimimally sized image, or using the image provided by the authors
  - We changed base containers over to debian instead of a heavy rockylinux base, also moved to multi-stage builds
- **Tool updates for bcftools, samtools, htslib, deepvariant, GATK, ichorCNA, sigprofiler, vardict**
- We have added support for user supplied variables for the variant filtering tasks
- New tools added:
  - CNVear
  - b_pure
- Added PCR Free workflow https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/15
- Since alignment must restart, https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/17 is handled
- Adjusted support for fasterq files https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/24
  - Petagene is only loaded for the copy fastq step and is decompressing the fasterq as part of the copy operation
- Multiple UMI aware alignment updates https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/25 https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/26 https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/27 https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/36 https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/37
- Adjusted memory usage for a couple of workflows including lancet and deepvariant https://github.com/tgen/tempe/issues/33
  - Deepvariant is using an example of memory request based on the numberOfReads in the sample, this is planned to be expanded upon
- Removed workflows that are outdated/superseded by newer tools:
  - snpEff
  - singleCellRNA support tasks (these will be broken into a separate pipeline in order to reduce workflow complexity)
  - lumosVar
  - CHIP/CutRun alignment and processing

This update will cause all tasks to restart based on the container changes, and we apologize for the inconvenience, it is technically possible to avoid this if jetstream is told 
to not include the container and digest as part of the task identity, rerender the workflow, and set tasks back to their previous state. Then mash the workflow with the new tempe
version. A lot of tasks will still restart as a result of this, but you might be able to avoid restarting back to the alignment steps. This operation is not recommended, but feel
free to contact bturner@tgen.org for assistance if this is required for your work.

**You must use Jetstream v1.7.3+ in order to run this pipeline**  
This is due to some additional template functions that have been added to the pipeline, namely an md5 function to render the md5sum of a file at render time, and assignBins, which is used to create and assign user defined bins.
